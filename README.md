# Final Project: Spotify Playlist Generator
By Jake Leale

Description: A tool that uses the Spotify's API to allow a user to make a playlist using their Liked Songs library, favorite songs, and songs from their favorite artists. 

## API Setup
To get started we must get access to Spotify's API. To do this we will visit the website https://developer.spotify.com/ and go to the dashboard. 
From there you will hit the create app button, and create the app that will give you a client id and client secret. 

## Pythonanywhere Setup
This project uses the website https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ to hold both its backend and frontend components. It is completely free and allows easy creation of a public domain. First, create an account or login to your current account. Next create a web app, you should be ready to go after downloading the files needed on this github repository. 

## Directory Set up 
After downloading the files, upload the my_flask_app.py into the /mysite folder. This should be located in the files tab. 
Next, create a folder within the /mysite directory, label it templates. From there place the remaining frontend files in this templates folder. This will not work if the directory is any different.
